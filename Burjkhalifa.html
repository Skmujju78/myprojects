      The Burj Khalifa (Burj Khalifa; Arabic: برج خليفة, Arabic pronunciation:
      [bʊrj Khalifa Tower), known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in
      2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height
      of 829.8 m (2,722 ft) (just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding
      antenna, but including a 244 m spire[2]) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj
      Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its
      topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that
      status.Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior
      completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced
      concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from
      the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German
      parliament.[5] 
      <br>
      <br>
      The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new
      development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centrepiece
      of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the
      building was based on the government's decision to diversify from an
      oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The
      building is named in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the
      United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan;[6] Abu Dhabi and the
      UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke
      numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building
      in the world.Burj Khalifa was designed by a team led by Adrian Smith of
      Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the Sears Tower in
      Chicago, a previous record holder for the world's tallest building.

      <br> Hyder
      Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group
      Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of
      the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the
      region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite
      floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A
      buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the
      building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj
      Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation with the
      exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.[7] The structure also
      features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot
      summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.

  <h2> Development</h2>

  <p>

    Construction began in January 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009. The building officially opened on 4 January 2010[12][13] and is part of the 2 km2 (490-acre) Downtown Dubai development at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district. The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill of Chicago, with Adrian Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as chief structural engineer.[14][15] The primary contractor was Samsung C&T of South Korea, together with local company Arabtec and the Belgian group BESIX.

            <i> <dd> <u> Plumbing systems </u> </dd>
                <p>The Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of 946,000 L (250,000 U.S. gal) of water per day through 100 km (62 mi) of pipes.[22][59] An additional 213 km (132 mi) of piping serves the fire emergency system, and 34 km (21 mi) supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system.</p>
            <dd> <u> Air Conditioning </u> </dd>
            <p>The air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground.[60] At peak cooling times, the tower's cooling is 46 MW (62,000 hp), equivalent to that provided by 13,000 short tons (26,000,000 lb; 12,000,000 kg) of melting ice in one day.[59] Water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park.</p>
            <dd> <u> Window cleaning </u> </dd>
            <p>To wash the 24,348 windows, totaling 120,000 m2 (1,290,000 sq ft) of glass, the building has three horizontal tracks, each holding a 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) bucket machine. Above level 109, and up to tier 27, traditional cradles from davits are used. The top of the building is cleaned by a crew that uses ropes to descend from the top to gain access.[61][62] Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units are operational, it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<hr>


<p> <b>The Dubai Fountain</b> 
    <br>
    Outside the Burj Khalifa, WET Enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of Dh 800 million (US$217 million). Illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors, it is 270 m (900 ft) long and shoots water 150 m (500 ft) into the air while accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and other music. It is the world's largest choreographed fountain.[65] On 26 October 2008, Emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the Dubai Fountain.[
</p>

<p>   <b>Observation deck</b> 
    An outdoor observation deck, named At the Top, opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor. At 452 m (1,483 ft), it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened.[67] Although it was surpassed in December 2011 by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower, Guangzhou at 488 m (1,601 ft),[68] Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at 555 m (1,821 ft), once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014,[69][70] until the Shanghai Tower opened in June 2016 with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres. The 124th floor observation deck also features the electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct° of Montréal, which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time, and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions.[71][72][73] To reduce the daily rush of sightseers, management allows visitors to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time, at a 75% discount on tickets purchased on the spot. <br>
    On 8 February 2010, the observation deck was closed to the public for two months after power-supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes.
</p>

<p> <b>Burj Khalifa park</b> <br>
    Burj Khalifa is surrounded by an 11 ha (27-acre) park designed by landscape architects SWA Group.[81] Like the tower, the park's design was based on the flower of the Hymenocallis, a desert plant.[82] At the centre of the park is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains. Benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower. <br>
    The plants are watered by water collected from the building's cooling system. The system provides 68,000,000 L (15,000,000 imp gal) annually.[83] WET Enterprises, who also developed the Dubai Fountain, developed the park's six water features. </p>
